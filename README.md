## Say Hello to PassesBox!
##### Your offline-secure password manager platform.

PassesBox is developed to help you in managing all your passwords. 
We have a lot of accounts on social media, emits, credit cards, etc. It's challenging to have a unique, complex, and secure password and remember them simultaneously!

#### 🤝  PassesBox is here to handle this for you.

👨🏻‍💻 Thanks to the Flutter framework, this application supports **Windows**, **Web**, **iOS**, and **Android** platforms.

🖥  PassesBox is entirely offline.
You can backup all your passwords on mobile and restore them on the web or desktop.

⚙️  This application uses **Hive no-SQL**, local **biometric authentication**, and a **secure encryption system** to make your experience fast and safe.

ℹ️  On the Windows platform, the backup file will save on the Downloads directory.
