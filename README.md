##### Your offline-secure password manager platform.

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrimatic/passesbox_readme/main/screenshot.png "screenshot")

PassesBox is developed to help you in managing all your passwords. 
We have a lot of accounts on social media, emits, credit cards, etc. It's challenging to have a unique, complex, and secure password and remember them simultaneously!

**🤝  PassesBox is here to handle this for you.**

PassesBox is entirely **offline**.
You can backup all your passwords on mobile and restore them on the web or desktop.

*On the Windows platform, the backup file will save on the **Downloads directory**.*

## Technical info
This application uses **no-SQL database**, local **biometric authentication**, and a **secure encryption system** to make your experience fast and safe.

Thanks to the Flutter framework, PassesBox supports **Windows**, **Web**, **iOS**, and **Android** platforms.
